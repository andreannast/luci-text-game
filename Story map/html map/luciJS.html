           Someone is ringing your doorbell. You get up from the chair in front of your computer and run to the door
    </p><p>
      excited. The mailman gives you a package and with a smile asks to sign on his device. You hastily do, then
    </p><p>
      close the door, and with shaking hands you cut the sealing tape with one of your keys. Inside the cardboard
    </p><p>
      box you find LUCI the most modern lucid dreaming headset. With this device you too will finally be able to
    </p><p>
      dream and know that you do on command. The possibilities are endless with this bad boy!
    </p><p /><p>
           While you were charging it you played with the settings and then looked up on the internet for ideas on

           You open your eyes and find yourself in an empty red room with a single door infront of you. On the walls
    </p><p>
      around you there are instraction written with big, white, bold letters. You ignore them -obviously- and go
    </p><p>
      to open the door, but before you do so you remember that you have to choose which place you wont there
